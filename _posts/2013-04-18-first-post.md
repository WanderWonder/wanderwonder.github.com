<p>On Monday, May 6, 2013, George Saunders returned to Northwestern University for a reading, book signing, and give a talk as part of the Contemporary Thought Speakers Series. I first discovered George Saunders when I was an young, unsuspecting freshman who saw a flyer on the ground for something called the "Writers Festival." I walked into the Hotel Orrington and found a seat, let's be honest, probably in the last row when this odd-looking man wearing glasses and with a head of wild, unruly hair began to read. And the words that came out of his mouth floored me. Let me give you just the first few lines of "Victory Lap."</p>

<p>Three days shy of her fifteenth birthday, Alison Pope paused at the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>Say the staircase was marble. Say she descended and all heads turned. Where was {special one}? Approaching now, bowing slightly, he exclaimed, How can so much grace be contained in one small package? Oops. Had he said small package? And just stood there? Broad princelike face totally bland of expression? Poor thing! Sorry, no way, down he went, he was definitely not {special one}.</p>

<p>What about this guy, behind Mr. Small Package, standing near the home entertainment center? With a thick neck of farmer integrity yet tender ample lips, who, placing one hand on the small of her back, whispered, Dreadfully sorry you had to endure that bit about the small package just now. Let us go stand on the moon. Or, uh, in the moon. In the moonlight.</p>
