    	In addition to a busy work schedule, Jessica enjoys travel and plans to visit China with a friend and her family following commencement. She also has a habit of stumbling upon odd opportunies, such as house-sitting in a mansion in Manhattan and hosting travelers from as far as Kosovo in her small apartment in Evanston. She collects books and not much else which is not a good choice when traveling and fulfilling miniscule international baggage limits. To learn more about Jessica's professional experience take a look at her <a href="{{ site.url }}/resume">resume</a> and feel free to <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact">contact</a>her if you feel so compelled. Return to every so often to read new writing from the mind of an ever curious examiner of life.</p>
